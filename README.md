# Titan

---
## How to run:
To run the program, open the command line/terminal on your machine, and navigate to the folder where the
jar file is located with:

``cd <path/to/folder/with/jar>``

Then, run the command:

``java -jar titanApproach.jar``

for the full flight to Titan, or:

``java -jar titanLanding.jar``

to proceed to landing directly. Both methods will proceed to landing eventually.

## Running the experiments:
If you are willing to run landing experiments/simulations without the UI (too see the effect of wind, atmosphere), run the main method of the
``WindExperiments`` class. 

## Manual

- To start and pause the simulation press `spacebar`
- You can freely zoom in and out using the `mouse scroll` / `trackpad`. You can see how much you have zoomed by looking at the scale in the lower right corner.
- You can also freely move around the Solar System by dragging you `mouse`
- You can see the current date in the upper left corner and some functional buttons to the right.
- Click on `center on <object>` to follow the object during the simulation
- Click on `mission log` and `engine log` to view more details about the current status of the mission and the processes happening within the engine of the rocket
